# Persistence1D
Persistence1D is a class for finding local extrema and their persistence 
in one-dimensional data. Local minima and local maxima are extracted, 
paired, and sorted according to their persistence.

The code runs in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of input points.

The download package comes with extensive documentation and examples.

You may use it as you wish, it is in the public domain. If you find it useful, 
it would be nice to hear from you. Just drop us a line.
